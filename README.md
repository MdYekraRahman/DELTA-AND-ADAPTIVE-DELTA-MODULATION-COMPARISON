# DELTA-AND-ADAPTIVE-DELTA-MODULATION-COMPARISON
A delta modulation (DM or âˆ† modulation) is an analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog signal conversion method used
for speech transmission when quality isn't a priority. The difference between successive samples is encoded into n-bit
data streams in DM, the simplest type of differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM). The transmitted data is reduced
to a 1-bit data stream via delta modulation. Delta Modulation still has several flaws that restrict its advantages and have
a detrimental effect on the communication process generating quantization errors. The two digital communication
methods Adaptive Delta Modulation (ADM) has been created by communication experts to address the abovementioned difficulties. We perform the digital communication systems indicated above in our project.
